# Templates
Okay. I get it. You're bored with the built in design or is having difficulties customizing it. 
Well, here is how you can build your own template (or just download this, and move all the templates to Softy/Templates directory
on your Android device.

Well, if you want to build your own, you need to have python installed on your computer (support for shell and batch is coming).
Once you have that installed, do this:

For Windows:
1. Download Git, set it up, and use both command line tools (in set up).
2. Either CD to the directory you downloaded this repo to, or head over via File Explorer, Shift+Right Click, and click open in git commandline (Somthing like that)
3. Run python gen.py and follow instructions

For Linux:
1. Open terminal, CD to the directory you installed this repo on
2. run 'python gen.py'

For Mac:
Same as Linux.

Windows one may not work, as you need python. This is why I have samples in Templates folder here. Just move the one you want to
Softy/Templates on your phone's storage (/ in this case does not mean or. It means to go to Softy, then Templates (create folders
if they do not exist).
